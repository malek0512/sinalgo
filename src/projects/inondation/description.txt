--  FLOOD  --

  a very simple example
  a random walk with one walker:
    there is only one message in the network
    this message is emitted by a (single) initiator (called InitNode)
    it is transmitted through the network 
       the next node is chosen at random uniformly among the neighbors
       (we call this function randomChoice)
    ... until it reaches its destination: the EndNode which stops it.
    
 Algorithm: (the message is called "flood")

    1: if InitNode then
    2:     send the msg to all the neighbours

	3: forever
    4:     receive the flood from some node N
    4:     if EndNode then
    5:          change of color (Black)
    			do nothing more
    6:     else
    			if this.color != default_color
    		        send the flood msg to the neighbours
    		        change color (Black)
